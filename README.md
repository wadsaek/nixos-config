## My config for me and now for you too! This might not be the best one there is, but it suits my needs!

# Important

The configuration does not include the hardware-configuration.nix file. add it youself. (You can probably do this by running the following:

```
cp /etc/nixos/configuration.nix ./nixos/
```

from the repository directory)
